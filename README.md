# codex-usage-dashboard

**English** | [日本語](README_ja.md)

`codex-usage-dashboard` is a local, single-binary dashboard for Codex usage,
credit estimates, and attribution.

It receives Codex OTLP logs, enriches them with local Codex metadata, polls the
current Codex usage window, and visualizes them in a dashboard.

## Requirements

- **Codex CLI**, installed and signed in
  - The dashboard still runs without it (credits and events come from OTLP), but
    the usage % gauges stay empty
- Codex set up to export OTLP (see [Configure Codex OTLP](#configure-codex-otlp))

## Quick Start

The prebuilt binary is **macOS only** (Apple Silicon). Download it from the
[Releases](../../releases) page, then run it:

```sh
unzip codex-usage-dashboard-macos-arm64.zip
chmod +x codex-usage-dashboard
./codex-usage-dashboard
```

The release binary is not currently signed or notarized. If macOS blocks it with
"Apple could not verify" and you trust the downloaded file, remove the quarantine
attribute and run it again:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine codex-usage-dashboard
./codex-usage-dashboard
```

On another platform, or want to build it yourself? Build from source — see
[`dev_docs/development.md`](dev_docs/development.md).

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4318/
```

By default the app listens only on localhost:

- OTLP gRPC: `127.0.0.1:4317`
- HTTP dashboard and OTLP/HTTP protobuf: `127.0.0.1:4318`

The local database is created at:

```text
data/codex-usage-dashboard.sqlite
```

relative to the directory where you run the binary.

## Configure Codex OTLP

The basic setup points Codex's OTLP log export directly at this dashboard's gRPC
receiver. Edit `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[otel]
exporter = { otlp-grpc = { endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:4317" } }
```

Restart Codex after changing the config. New Codex activity should start filling
the dashboard within about a minute.

Keep this dashboard process running while you use Codex to capture new OTLP
events. Events emitted while it is stopped are not backfilled.

### Already exporting Codex OTLP elsewhere?

This dashboard listens on the standard OTLP ports (gRPC `:4317`, HTTP `:4318`) so
Codex can point at it directly. If you already run an
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) on those ports,
keep Codex pointed at the collector, fan out a copy to this dashboard, and move
the dashboard off the standard ports.

Quarkus reads a `.env` file from the working directory, so put the overrides
there:

```sh
# .env
QUARKUS_GRPC_SERVER_PORT=14317
QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=14318
```

Then have the collector send OTLP/HTTP protobuf to `http://127.0.0.1:14318/v1/logs`
(or gRPC to `:14317`).

## LAN Access

The dashboard is local-only by default. It has **no authentication**, and the
raw-log drill-down (`/api/events/{id}/raw`) returns verbatim OTLP records that can
include working directories, conversation ids, host names, and account metadata.
Exposing it on your LAN gives **every device on the network unauthenticated read
access to that data** — only do this on a trusted network.

To intentionally expose it on your LAN:

```sh
QUARKUS_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
QUARKUS_GRPC_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
./codex-usage-dashboard
```

Then open `http://<machine-ip>:4318/` from another device.

## Configuration

Useful environment variables:

```sh
# Ports / bind addresses
QUARKUS_HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=4318
QUARKUS_GRPC_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
QUARKUS_GRPC_SERVER_PORT=4317

# Local storage
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL='jdbc:sqlite:data/codex-usage-dashboard.sqlite?journal_mode=WAL&busy_timeout=10000'

# Codex local state used for enrichment
CODEX_STATE5_PATH="$HOME/.codex/state_5.sqlite"
CODEX_LOGS2_PATH="$HOME/.codex/logs_2.sqlite"
CODEX_BIN=codex
```

## OTLP Support

Supported:

- OTLP/gRPC on `:4317`
- OTLP/HTTP protobuf on `:4318/v1/logs`
- gzip-compressed OTLP/HTTP protobuf bodies

Not supported:

- OTLP/HTTP JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`)

OTLP/HTTP JSON requests return `415 Unsupported Media Type` so misconfigured
exporters do not appear to succeed while silently dropping data. Make sure any
OTLP/HTTP exporter sends protobuf (`encoding: proto`), not JSON.
